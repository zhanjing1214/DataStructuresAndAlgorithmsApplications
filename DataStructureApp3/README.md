Topics: Stacks, Red Black Trees and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

- Implement a stack class holding Jva objects. It can automated grow when needed.
- Implement a red black tree with a pair of string and big integer stored in each tree node.
- Implement an application which reads and evaluates postfix expressions involving BigIntegers and variables with the help of the stack and redblack tree implemented above. It reads a line from the user, evaluates the expression and displays the result. It continues to do this until the user hits the return key with no input or it encounters an error. It can deal with standard binary operations: +, -, *, /, %, =; also ~ (unary minus), # (powerMod) . Exceptions are caught if there is any invalid postfix expression.
