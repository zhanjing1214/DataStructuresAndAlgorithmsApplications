### App1

This project includes 4 small parts. I tried to implement some basic data structures and manipulate them to build Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem.

#### Q1

Implement a doubly-linked-list with character storing in each node. A test driver is included.

#### Q2

Implement key generation, encryption and decryption using the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem. This application can encrypt and decrypt with strings of less than 80 characters in length. The application continuously promps the user to input the string to encrypt and decrypt. Warning will be displayed when length of string exccessed 80.

#### Q3

This part also implement the key generation, encryption and decryption using the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem.  The difference is that q2 uses doubly linked lists while q3 uses arrays. Therefore, good use of abstractions help to reuse most of the codes in q2.

#### Q4

Build a singly linked list with character storing in each node and implement a static method that takes two singly linked lists of characters as input and returns a third singly linked list of characters. A test driver is included.
